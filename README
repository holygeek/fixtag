TL;DR: Vim doesn't seem to have support for jumping the the typeref
immediately, hence this program.

The full story
--------------

Some C source files has many of the following struct typedef patterns:

    typedef struct __some_name Name;

    struct __some_name {

    };

Which generates (possibly annoying) tags like this:

    Name      file.h  /^typedef struct __some_name Name/      t       typeref:struct:__some_name
    __some_name       file.h  /struct __some_name {/  s

fixtag modifies the entries such that the former's locator is the
same as the latter's:

    Name      file.h  /^struct __some_name {/ t       typeref:struct:__some_name
    __some_name       file.h  /^struct __some_name {/ s
